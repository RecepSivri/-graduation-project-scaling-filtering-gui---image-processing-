Nowadays engineers and workers usually use more than one filters in image processing project.In this project we provide a visual design environment for this workers and engineers using javaFx.

Now If I talk about user interface ,the user interface components are :
    
 1.STATUSBOX:
         -Status box is a box that provides informations about filter that is used.

 2.TOOLBOX:
         -Tool box is a box that provides all tools that are used to design.

  3.FILTERBOX:
         -Filter box is a box that provides all filters and operators that are used to design.

 4.LOGGERSCREEN:
        -This is a screen that provides bugs and information about design.

 5.MENU:
         -Menu for user.
